# Dress-Detection-using-Faster-RCNN-with-Inception-Resnet-V2

### Summary

Step by Step Tutorial of Detecting dresses through the state of the art neural network Faster RCNN with Inception Resnet V2 in real-time.
This repository will not only guide you on how to Detect Clothing Items from an Image, Video or Webcam feed but
will also enable you to train your own Object Detection Classifier. The TensorFlow's Object Detection API is basically made for Linux
but this guide will show you how to use TensorFlow's Object Detection API to train an object detection classifier for multiple objects on Windows 10, 8, or 7..
Ofcourse, this will also work on Linus platforms with minor changes. This repository was done with tensorflow 2.1 but should also with 
older or newer tensorflow versions.

Below are the steps that we are going to follow if we want to train our own Classifier.

1. [Install Anaconda, CUDA and cuDNN](https://github.com/fahim-arshad/Dress-Detection-using-Faster-RCNN-with-Inception-Resnet-V2/new/master?readme=1#1-install-anaconda-cuda-and-cudnn)
2. [Set up Object Detection Directory](https://github.com/fahim-arshad/Dress-Detection-using-Faster-RCNN-with-Inception-Resnet-V2/new/master?readme=1#2-set-up-object-detection-directory)
3. [Set up the Virtual Environment](https://github.com/fahim-arshad/Dress-Detection-using-Faster-RCNN-with-Inception-Resnet-V2/new/master?readme=1#3-set-up-the-virtual-environment)
4. [Label pictures](https://github.com/fahim-arshad/Dress-Detection-using-Faster-RCNN-with-Inception-Resnet-V2/new/master?readme=1#4-label-pictures)
5. [Generate *.csv* and *tfrecord files*](https://github.com/fahim-arshad/Dress-Detection-using-Faster-RCNN-with-Inception-Resnet-V2/new/master?readme=1#5-generate-csv-and-tfrecord-files)
6. [Create Label Map](https://github.com/fahim-arshad/Dress-Detection-using-Faster-RCNN-with-Inception-Resnet-V2/new/master?readme=1#6-create-label-map)
7. [Training](https://github.com/fahim-arshad/Dress-Detection-using-Faster-RCNN-with-Inception-Resnet-V2/new/master?readme=1#7-training)
8. [Export the Inference Graph (Object Detection CLassifier)](https://github.com/fahim-arshad/Dress-Detection-using-Faster-RCNN-with-Inception-Resnet-V2/new/master?readme=1#8-export-the-inference-graph-object-detection-classifier)
9. [Test your Classifier](https://github.com/fahim-arshad/Dress-Detection-using-Faster-RCNN-with-Inception-Resnet-V2/new/master?readme=1#9-test-your-classifier)
